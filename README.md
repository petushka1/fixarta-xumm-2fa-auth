Fixarta XRPL Marketplace is designed to serve as a decentralized Platform + API for easy and fast integration. XUMM API integration ensures 100% decentralization and provides easy sign-in with your XRPL account.
Marketplace is designed and planned to provide the functionality needed to ensure seamless and trusted interaction between brands, producers, creators, and ultimately a customer.  
Features:
- You have full and exclusive control over your XRPL account and are 100% responsible for managing your account secret
